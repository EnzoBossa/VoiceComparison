sample and sample5 are 2 different recordings of my voice to test as a baseline of comparison. 

At first I tried using resemblyzer but the results were not very accurate. Different voices were getting around a 70-80% match so I then switched
over to speechbrain. Results were much better with around a 40-50% match on different voices and 80-90% on same voices.
